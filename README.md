# class-diagram-javafx
## This code base forked from my school's gitlab where I worked in a team of 3 to build a UML-class-diagram using javafx from scratch. This project is part of a design pattern class.
## I was in charged of making the relationship between two classes and displaying them, writing unit tests and documentation. I had to learn javafx, different test suites (test spy, test mock object, etc.) and merge git branches, resolve conflicts, use LucidChart,  as I was doing this project and implement different design patterns to the program.
